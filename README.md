NodeOrmApi_104
================
Study of [Sequelize][1s] ORM. Though [TypeORM][2s] looks interesting too.
 
 The old projects are here
 
 1. Node, MySQL [NodeOrmApi_101][1] 
 2. Node, MySQL [NodeOrmApi_102][2]

These are projects where I am trying to connect to SQL database. There are other projects connecting to NoSQL database.
 
 1. Node and MongoDB [NodeOrmApi_103][3]

### Workings

Generated the application with `express-generator` and `npx` not `npm`.

```
npx express-generator --view=pug myNewApp
```

Installing the requirements.

```
npm install --save mysql2
npm install --save sequelize
```
