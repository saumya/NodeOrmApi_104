NodeOrmApi_104
================

Study of [Sequelize][1s] ORM by making a project with it. 
Now it has different UI as another projects.

### Status

 - [x] checking from the UI
 - [x] basic API for all
 - [x] CRUD is done for most
 - [x] Test done from UI Application
 - [ ] General Error Handling


### How it works

 - Groups are made to separate different Organisations
 - DoctorGroups help separate different Doctors to different organisations




### Generic Information 

[TypeORM][2s] looks interesting too.
 
 The old projects are here
 
 1. Node, MySQL [NodeOrmApi_101][1] 
 2. Node, MySQL [NodeOrmApi_102][2]

These are projects where I am trying to connect to SQL database. There are other projects connecting to NoSQL database.
 
 1. Node and MongoDB [NodeOrmApi_103][3]

### Developing with this

Generated the application with `express-generator` and `npx` not `npm`.

```
npx express-generator --view=pug myNewApp
```

Installing the requirements.

```
npm install --save mysql2
npm install --save sequelize
```
